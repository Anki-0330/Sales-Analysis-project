#### Data Source

Bike Sales Data: The Primary Dataset used for this analysis is the "Bike Sales Dataset.CSV" containing detailed information about each sale made by the company. 

#### Tools

-Excel: Data celaning, Data Analysis and Reports.[Download Here](https://microsoft.com)

#### Data Cleaning and preparation 

In the initial preparation Phase, we performed the following tasks:

  1. Removed Duplicates.
  2. Replaced inaccurate values.
  3. Added age brackets for precise analysis. 
 
#### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer the key questions, Such as:

   1. What is the average income based on Gender?
   2. What is the count of purchase based on age?
   3. what is the count of purhase based on commute distance?

#### Key Features

   1. Age Bracket Analysis
   2. Commute Distance Analysis
   3. Average Income Insights
   4. Purchase Count Visualization
   5. Interactive Elements

#### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

  1. The 25-35 age bracket has the highest average income and purchase count, indicating that this group is a significant market segment for bike sales. This age group might be targeted with specific marketing 
     campaigns or product offerings to capitalize on their interest in purchasing bikes.
  2. Customers with a commute distance of 5-10 miles have the highest average income and purchase count. This suggests that there is a strong demand for bikes among individuals with moderate commute distances.
  3. There is a general trend of higher average income corresponding to higher purchase counts across all age brackets and commute distances. This indicates that customers with higher incomes are more likely to 
     purchase bikes, regardless of their age or commute distance.
  4. The analysis also reveals potential growth opportunities in underrepresented segments.
 
#### Recomendation

Based on the Analysis we recommend the following actions

   1. Targeting specific age brackets or commute distance categories with promotions or discounts. Also considering income levels when designing marketing campaigns.


#### Limitations

   1. Excel has limitations in handling large datasets, which can affect the dashboard's performance and responsiveness, especially when dealing with complex calculations or visualizations.
   2. Excel's interactivity features, such as filters and slicers, are limited compared to more advanced data visualization tools. This can restrict the depth of analysis and exploration of the data.
   3. Collaborating on the dashboard with multiple users can be challenging, as Excel files are typically stored locally and may not support real-time collaboration features.
